New features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- new workflow for forum posts, with two new states : rejected, unpublished
- messages posted by users with Forum Moderate permission are now directly
  published for both a priori and a posteriori moderation modes
- threads are now sorted by most recent post (default view, no explicit sorting)
- use a rich text editor widget to edit posts
- attaching documents to posts (as internal links)
- member's information is displayed in a popup window when clicking on author
  name
- posts can be sorted by thread, subject, date, author
- forum content is now batched by default (default setting is 30 threads/posts
  per page)

Bug fixes:
~~~~~~~~~~
- display "Modify" button only for posts that are not published (thus not
  modifiable)
- Add an explicit message when you not have rights to post a comment
- users who were explicitely set as ForumModerator were not allowed
  to view posts in several states like pending (users who inherited this
  permission from other roles like SectionReviewer were not subject to this
  bug)
