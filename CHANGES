- security is now managed through permissions. CPSDefault's roles are mapped to
  these permissions (managers can moderate, members and readers can post)
- old ForumModerator and ForumPoster roles still exist and are mapped to the
  according permissions, so that it remains possible to assign forum permissions
  to users without any other particular role
- notifications of new messages can be sent to explicitly declared moderators in
  a posteriori mode
- now possible to lock a forum (read-only)
