CPSForum

  o A forum should have an additional property to select which of the users
    with moderations rights is the official moderators.

Future developments
  
  o Read markings together with 'next unread' actions and such.

  o 'Forwarding' or 'proxy' posts together with 'post reply as new
    thread'-action.

  o I would prefer to only list the main subjects in the forum view, and
    then have post views that show the thread. This however is only a good
    idea when read markings have been implemented, so that you can easily see
    in which threads you have unread.

  o Ratings. OK, so that's a whole new product, really. ;)
