NuxCPSForum4

  x When the forum is viewed with no post selected, the first post is shown.
    That's bad (but now it's fixed).

  x The time of the post should be visible in the listing.

  x When you delete the post you are at, by selecting it at the list, it
    tries to show the post after deleting it, which fails. This must be fixed.

  x Posts should not be stored in the 'talkback' attribute, but in the
    portal_discussion tool.

  x There need to be skins for setting local roles so that you can select who has
    moderator rights.

  x A forum should have an additional property to select which of the users with
    moderations rights is the official moderators.

  x Localize all non-localized shtuff.

  x Fix the expanding and collpsing of branches.

  Future developments

    o Read markings together with 'next unread' actions and such.

    o 'Forwarding' or 'proxy' posts together with 'post reply as new thread'-action.

    o I would prefer to only list the main subjects in the forum view, and
      then have post views that show the thread. This however is only a good idea
      when read markings have been implemented, so that you can easily see in which
      threads you have unread.

    o Ratings. OK, so that's a whole new product, really. ;)
