Installation of CPSForum

  CPSForum requires either CPS2 or CPS3, amke sure this is installed and
  working first.

  Unpack the distribution into the Products folder of your Zope installation
  and restart Zope. Check in Control_Panel/Products that there is a CPSForum
  product and that there were no import errors.

  You should now have two new portal_types called 'Forum' and 'Post'. Posts are
  only allowed to be created in forums, and that's how it should be. If you
  have filtering on your sections and workspaces, make sure that you allow
  Forums to be created there.

  # FIXME: this is old documentation. FIX THIS.

  You now need to add some more skin directories to the portal_skins folder.
  There will be two new skin fodlers registered, called
  Products/CPSForum/skins/cmf and Products/CPSForum/skins/cps. If you have CPS3
  installed, there will also be a third folder called
  Products/CPSForum/skins/cps3 installed.

  In portal_skins, create new Filesystem Directory Views for these above
  directories. Name them nuxcpsforum4_cmf, nuxcpsforum4_cps and, for CPS3 also
  nuxcpsforum4_cps3.  Enter the properties page of portal_skins and add these
  directory views to the end of all your skin definitions and press save.

  You should now be able to create forums and use them.
