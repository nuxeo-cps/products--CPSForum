Installation of CPSForum

  CPSForum requires CPS3.

- Unpack the distribution into the Products folder of your Zope installation
  and restart Zope. Check in Control_Panel/Products that there is a CPSForum
  product and that there were no import errors.

- From the ZMI, go to the CPS root, instanciate an External Method with the
  following parameters:
  ID = any Id you want, like cpsforuminst
  Title = anything you want, like CPSForum Installer
  Module Name = CPSForum.install
  Function Name = install

- You should now have CPSForum in portal_types and cps_forum in portal_skins

- If you have filtering on your sections and workspaces, make sure
  that you allow Forums to be created there.

- You can then go to the section/workspace of your choice and instantiate a
  CPSForum.

Discussions (comments about documents)
--------------------------------------------------
- If your document is discussable, an action in the action box makes it
  possible to add comments to your document. These comments are managed
  by a CPSForum (a forum is associated with each document that contains
  comments). Beware: the forum is associated with the document, not the
  proxy(ies) that refer to it, meaning that the forum is shared by the
  various versions of the document (published in sections, or workgroup
  drafts). The forum objects themselves are stored in portal_comment and
  are hidden from the user (the user sees an interface to the forum through
  the document being commented ; he does not directly access the forum).
