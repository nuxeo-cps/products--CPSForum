Installation of CPSForum

  CPSForum requires CPS3.

- Unpack the distribution into the Products folder of your Zope installation
  and restart Zope. Check in Control_Panel/Products that there is a CPSForum
  product and that there were no import errors.

- From the ZMI, go to the CPS root, instanciate an External Method with the
  following parameters:
  ID = any Id you want, like cpsforum_install
  Title = anything you want, like CPSForum Installer
  Module Name = CPSForum.install
  Function Name = install

- You should now have CPSForum in portal_types and cps_forum in portal_skins

- If you have filtering on your sections and workspaces, make sure
  that you allow Forums to be created there.

- You can then go to the section/workspace of your choice and instantiate a
  CPSForum.

--------------------------------------------------
Discussions (comments about documents)
--------------------------------------------------
- If your document is discussable, an action in the action box makes it
  possible to activate comments for your document. If they are activated,
  a new action makes it possible to actually comment the document.
  These comments are managed by a CPSForum (a forum is associated with each
  document that contains comments). Beware: the forum is associated with the
  proxy document, not the actual document in the repository, meaning that
  the forum is not shared by the various versions of the document (published
  in sections, or workgroup drafts). The forum objects themselves are stored
  in a specific .cps_discussions in the parent folder (workspace or content)
  and are hidden from the user.
