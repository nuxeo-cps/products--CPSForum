- CPS3

Installation notes
--------------------------------------------------

- Unpack the distribution into the Products folder of your Zope installation
  and change its name 'CPSForum-X.X.X-X' to 'CPSForum'

- Restart Zope. Check in Control_Panel/Products that there is a CPSForum
  product and that there were no import errors.

- From the ZMI, go to the CPS root, instantiate an External Method with the
  following parameters:
  ID = any Id you want, like cpsforum_install
  Title = anything you want, like CPSForum Installer
  Module Name = CPSForum.install
  Function Name = install

- After creating, open the External Method object and click the "Test" tab to
  run it.

- You should now have CPSForum and ForumPost in portal_types and cps_forum in
  portal_skins.

- If you have filtering on your sections and workspaces, make sure
  that you allow CPSForum to be created there. You can also have a look at the
  workflow configuration in sections and workspaces, as described in the
  'Update notes' section below.

- You can then go to the section/workspace of your choice and instantiate a
  CPSForum.

Update notes
--------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT NOTE:
This version of CPSForum and all subsequent versions based on CPSDocument
posts are incompatible with existing Forum instances that have been created
with earlier versions of CPSForum (i.e. which do not use CPSDocument posts).
This means all versions up to (and including) release 0.7.0-1 released in
April 2004.

Some workflow configuration might not be updated properly when executing the
installer. So please make sure that:
- in /cps/sections/.cps_workflow_configuration:
  * portal type CPSForum follows: section_forum_wf
  *  portal type ForumPost follows: forum_post_wf
- in /cps/workspaces/.cps_workflow_configuration:
  * portal type CPSForum follows: workspace_forum_wf
  * portal type ForumPost follows: forum_post_wf
