This README documents the new version of CPSForum that stores posts as
CPSDocuments.

Features and changes w.r.t earlier implementations:
- posts are now searchable,
- posts follow their own workflow (forum_post_wf) and have a publication
  status (see doc/forum_wf.svg for a graphical representation of this workflow),
- comments are still stored in Forum objects, but there is no longer
  a comment_mode: standard forums are used in this context (some scripts
  differ slightly, but it is of no consequence to the user). This means
  that all standard forum features (moderation, notification, locking, etc.)
  are available in forums used for commenting documents,
- new permissions make it possible to fine tune who is allowed to do what
  on forums (see below for more information). 

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- This version of CPSForum and all subsequent versions based on CPSDocument
  posts are incompatible with existing Forum instances that have been created
  with earlier versions of CPSForum (i.e. which do not use CPSDocument posts).
  This means all versions up to (and including) release 0.7.0-1 of April 2004.

Some details about roles and permissions associated with forums:
- there are three permissions associated with forums: 
  * 'Forum Moderate' required to publish/unpublish/delete posts,
  * 'Forum Post' required to post new messages,
  * 'Forum manage comments' required to activate/deactivate comments about a
    given document.

- those three permissions are mapped to CPSDefault roles as follows:
  for standard forums:
    * Forum Moderate = WorkspaceManager, Section Manager, Section Reviewer,
                       Owner
    * Forum Post = WorkspaceManager, WorkspaceMember, WorkspaceReader,
                   SectionManager, SectionReviewer, SectionReader,
                   Owner
    * Forum manage comments = WorkspaceManager, Section Manager,
                              Section Reviewer, Owner

In addition, it is possible to assign roles ForumModerator and ForumPoster
(which speak for themselves) locally in a forum. It is also possible to
change default settings by using CPSInstaller.setupPortalPermissions()
