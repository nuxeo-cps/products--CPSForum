Introduction
--------------------------------------------------

CPSForum provides newsgroups and discussion threads, anywhere on the site.
It also makes it possible to comment on documents.
See the 'Features' section below for more information.

--------------------------------------------------
History & Bug fixes
--------------------------------------------------

For history and bug fixes, please refer to the HISTORY file.

Still, important features and changes w.r.t implementations (CPSForum v. 0.X.X)
are given here:
- posts are now searchable,
- posts follow their own workflow (forum_post_wf) and have a publication
  status (see doc/forum_wf.svg for a graphical representation of this workflow),
- comments are still stored in Forum objects, but there is no longer
  a comment_mode: standard forums are used in this context (some scripts
  differ slightly, but it is of no consequence to the user). This means
  that all standard forum features (moderation, notification, locking, etc.)
  are available in forums used for commenting documents,
- new permissions make it possible to fine tune who is allowed to do what
  on forums (see below for more information).

--------------------------------------------------
Installation
--------------------------------------------------

For installation information, please refer to the INSTALL file.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
This version of CPSForum and all subsequent versions based on CPSDocument
posts are incompatible with existing Forum instances that have been created
with earlier versions of CPSForum (i.e. which do not use CPSDocument posts).
This means all versions up to (and including) release 0.7.0-1 of April 2004.

Roles and permissions
--------------------------------------------------

Some details about roles and permissions associated with forums:
- there are three permissions associated with forums:
  * 'Forum Moderate' required to publish/unpublish/delete posts,
  * 'Forum Post' required to post new messages,
  * 'Forum manage comments' required to activate/deactivate comments about a
    given document.

- those three permissions are mapped to CPSDefault roles as follows:
  for standard forums:
    * Forum Moderate = WorkspaceManager, Section Manager, Section Reviewer,
                       Owner
    * Forum Post = WorkspaceManager, WorkspaceMember, WorkspaceReader,
                   SectionManager, SectionReviewer, SectionReader,
                   Owner
    * Forum manage comments = WorkspaceManager, Section Manager,
                              Section Reviewer, Owner

In addition, it is possible to assign roles ForumModerator and ForumPoster
(which speak for themselves) locally in a forum. It is also possible to
change default settings by using CPSInstaller.setupPortalPermissions()


--------------------------------------------------
Discussions (comments about documents)
--------------------------------------------------

If your document is discussable, an action in the action box makes it
possible to activate comments for your document. If they are activated,
a new action makes it possible to actually comment the document.
These comments are managed by a CPSForum (a forum is associated with each
document that contains comments). Beware: the forum is associated with the
proxy document, not the actual document in the repository, meaning that
the forum is not shared by the various versions of the document (published
in sections, or workgroup drafts). The forum objects themselves are stored
in a specific .cps_discussions in the parent folder (workspace or content)
and are hidden from the user.
