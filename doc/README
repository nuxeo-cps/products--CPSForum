Introduction
--------------------------------------------------

CPSForum provides newsgroup-like discussion threads anywhere on the site.
It also makes it possible to make comments about documents also organized
by threads. See the 'Features' section below for more information.

--------------------------------------------------
History & Bug fixes
--------------------------------------------------

Important features and changes w.r.t CPSForum releases earlier than 0.8.x:
- posts are now searchable,
- posts follow their own workflow (forum_post_wf) and have a publication
  status (see doc/forum_wf.svg for a graphical representation of this workflow),
- comments are still stored in Forum objects, but there is no longer
  a comment_mode: standard forums are used in this context (some scripts
  differ slightly, but it is of no consequence to the user). This means
  that all standard forum features (moderation, notification, locking, etc.)
  are available in forums used for commenting documents,
- new permissions make it possible to fine tune who is allowed to do what
  on forums (see below for more information).

For history and bug fixes, please refer to the HISTORY file.

--------------------------------------------------
Installation
--------------------------------------------------

For installation information, please refer to the INSTALL file.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
This version of CPSForum and all subsequent versions based on CPSDocument
posts are incompatible with existing Forum instances that have been created
with earlier versions of CPSForum (i.e. which do not use CPSDocument posts).
This means all versions up to (and including) release 0.7.0-1 released in
April 2004.

--------------------------------------------------
Features
--------------------------------------------------

Forum objects can be created in sections or workspaces.

- Forum settings
  o Moderation
    It is possible to assign moderators to any forum.
    There are two moderation modes:
    * 'a priori': messages posted have to be validated by a moderator
      to be visible by other users.
    * 'a posteriori': messages are published (and thus visible) directly after
      their posting.  Moderators can unpublish or delete them afterwards.
  o Anonymous posts: it is possible to allow anonymous users to post messages
    on a forum.
  o Locking mechanism: it is possible to lock a forum, making it read only.
    Locks can also be set at a finer grain (thread level: forbid new replies
    to a given thread)
  o Number of discussion threads per page: a maximum number of threads per page
    can be set. The value 0 means that there is no limit (all threads are
    displayed on the same page).

- Forum post handling
  Users allowed to post messages can create new discussion threads or answer to
  messages in other discussion threads.
  If the forum is moderated 'a priori', the message will appear in the thread
  with a red spot in front of it, meaning that other users cannot see it
  (moderators can of course see a pending message, as well as the user who
  created it).
  Users moderating the forum can publish this kind of messages, making them
  visible to all the other users in this forum.
  Moderators can also unpublish, or even delete messages.

--------------------------------------------------
Roles and permissions
--------------------------------------------------

Some details about roles and permissions associated with forums:

- there are three permissions associated with forums:
  * 'Forum Moderate' required to publish/unpublish/delete posts,
  * 'Forum Post' required to post new messages,
  * 'Forum manage comments' required to activate/deactivate comments about a
    given document.

- those three permissions are mapped to CPSDefault roles as follows:
    * Forum Moderate = WorkspaceManager, Section Manager, Section Reviewer,
                       Owner
    * Forum Post = WorkspaceManager, WorkspaceMember, WorkspaceReader,
                   SectionManager, SectionReviewer, SectionReader,
                   Owner
    * Forum manage comments = WorkspaceManager, Section Manager,
                              Section Reviewer, Owner

In addition, it is possible to assign roles ForumModerator and ForumPoster
(which speak for themselves) locally in a forum. It is also possible to
change default settings by using CPSInstaller.setupPortalPermissions()

A given user must have access to a forum object to be able to use his/her
roles specific to the forum.

--------------------------------------------------
Discussions (comments about documents)
--------------------------------------------------

If your document is discussable (allow_discussion set to true),
an action in the action box makes it possible to activate comments for your
document. If comments are activated, a new action makes it possible to
actually comment the document. These comments are managed by a CPSForum object
(a forum is associated with each document that contains comments). 
Beware: the forum is associated with the proxy document, not the actual
document in the repository, meaning that the forum is not shared by the
various versions of the document (published in sections, or workgroup drafts).
Forum objects themselves are stored in a specific .cps_discussions folder in the
document-being-commented's parent folder (workspace or section) and are hidden
from the user.
