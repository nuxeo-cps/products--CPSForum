Using the Module
================

CPSForum is a tool that enables users of a portal to post messages
in forums, in threads of discussion.  It also associates comments
with these documents.  These comments are managed as discussion
threads.


History of the Module
=====================

The CPSForum product has existed since CPS2.  It has been ported
to CPS3.  These initial versions are numbered 0.X.X.  It was then
completely refactored, and this new version is numbered 1.X.X.

Forum objects created with versions numbered 0.X.X are not
compatible with those created with versions of CPSForum numbered
1.X.X.


Requirements for Use of the Module
==================================

CPSForum requires:

- CPS3

- The CPSInstaller product (not included with CPS-3.0, but
  included with CPS-3.1)

- CPSSchemas > 0.18.0-1 (not included in CPS-3.0, but included in 
  CPS-3.1)

- CPSSubscriptions > 0.7.0-1 -- for the management of notifications
  (not included in CPS3)

CPSForum has been tested with Zope 2.6 and Zope 2.7.


Installation
============

Uncompress the archive containing the module in the ``Products``
directory.  Rename the resulting directory to "CPSForum".  Restart
Zope.  Note that you can also obtain CPSForum from SVN at:
http://svn.nuxeo.org/.

The file ``INSTALL`` in the ``doc/`` directory of the product
contains information about installation in a CPS instance.  It
also gives information about updating, when an earlier version of
CPSForum has already been installed in your CPS instance.


Capabilities of the Module
==========================

Also see the documentation on the capabilities of CNCC.

There are no additional functions compared to those described to
the functional capabilities described in the document by CNCC.

The ``README`` file in the ``doc/`` of the product gives a
succinct description of the capabilities, as well as how to use
the module.


General Functionality
=====================

CPSForum objects (instances of class Forum in ``Forum.py``)
appear in folders and reside in the repository.  As with other
folders (Workspace, Section, ...), proxies point to the forums
from the repository.  A CPSForum object follows the workflows
workspace_content_wf or section_content_wf respectively
according to whether it resides in a workspace or a section.

The posts are CPSDocuments, which follow their own workflow
(forum_post_wf). The workflow manages the work of forum moderators
and the publication of messages when the forum is operating in
moderated mode.  A diagram (``doc/forum_wf.svg``) describes the
workflow that is followed by posts.

As with other instances of CPSDocument, forum posts are stored in
the repository and are referenced by proxies which reside in the
proxy associated with the forum.

The documents in a forum are indexed and are searched during
searches.

The declaration of permissions utilized by forums is done in the
module ``CPSForumPermissions.py``.

The connection between roles and permissions is established in the
CPSForum installer (``Extensions/install.py``), and can be easily
modified in a client installation of the product.


Comments on Documents
=====================

The comments associated with a document are stored in an object of
type CPSForum as documents of type ForumPost.  From a functional
point of view, nothing distinguishes a standard CPSForum from a
CPSForum used to store comments associated with a document.  Forum
objects used to comment on a document (abbreviated cforums) use
the same storage mechanism: the repository with proxies that refer
to them.

The proxies associated with cforums are stored in the following way:

- If the comment document is workspaces/ws1/doc1

- The proxy of cforum associated is
  workspaces/ws1/.cps_discussions/doc1.

The forum then has the same ID as the document, but is found in a
special directory cached for the user (and visible there after
within the ZMI).

The class ``CommentTool`` (in ``CommentTool.py``) is used to
manage the comments associated with a document, especially to
establish the connection between a document and the forum with
which it is associated (if it exists).  That class replaces (with
monkey patching) the portal_discussion object from CMF (adding
some functionality).

The CPSForum class (in ``Forum.py``) also manages callbacks on
CPSSubscriptions in order to produce notifications of the creation
and the publication of new posts and comments.
